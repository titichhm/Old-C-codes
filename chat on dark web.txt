me	wbu	
me	what are your interests	
->	politivcal engagement is important to kick all the fascist asses, but you dont have to sit all day and cry about every shit in the news. i like sports too 	20:47
me	where i m from,more than half of population breathes politics and religion,even though it won't earn them single penny	20:48
->	stupid religion	20:49
me	even i m into football(kinda)	20:49
me	it's a good way to kill time	
me	yep religion is stupid	
->	football is not a thing for me, but i like stuff like boxing	20:49
me	that's cool too	20:50
me	so u r into watching it or u do it also?	
->	i did it for a couple of years	20:50
->	befor i did selfdefence, maybe you heard about it - wingtsun	20:51
me	no	20:51
me	never heard of it	
->	pretty effective and fast	20:51
me	boxing is not a thing here,so i am not aware of anything related to it	20:52
->	maybe just google it sometime	20:52
me	sure	20:52
->	and dont wonder, there are so many ways to write is, but ist all the same	20:52
me	i was into gaming throughout my life,but making a career in it is risky and short term	20:53
me	and sports require too much physical hard work	
->	what do u play?	20:53
me	very type of video game,every fucking genre	20:53
me	i have been playing since i was 3	
me	in real life,i have never met anyone who knew about gaming more than me	20:54
->	at long term, "real" sport is way better. as you said - fuck religion - if you wanna do something good for you just do sport and eat well	20:54
me	it actually depends,what good is,based on the person's views	20:55
me	for a drug addict,for a cop,for an old man	
me	good is non-existent	
->	true	20:56
me	u define ur own goodness	20:56
me	for me,it is to make something of my life,and experience as much as possible	
->	smart 	20:56
->	a friend and me had a interisting conversation before i started chatting here	20:57
->	if everyone has a soul, could it really possible to sell a soul and what is happening after? 	20:58
->	if this would would, could i go to a lawyer and get so my sould maybe back?	20:59
me	lol	20:59
me	this sounds like someone who is into dark movies and that sorta stuff	
->	not really	21:00
me	there is no soul,man	21:00
->	we just took a walk	21:00
->	i know... we die and end of the story	
me	we are bags of cells and energy,who have a brain to keep this bag alive	21:00
->	but if there would be a soul, like many people belive	21:01
me	i don't believe in that concept	21:01
me	but i respect everyone's views	
->	we had a nice compare	21:02
->	what is, if the soul would be everyones masterboot record?	
me	interesting	21:03
